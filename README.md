# Using FIWARE as a platform for Smart Solutions: architecture and methodologies 

In this thesis work I analyzed the FIWARE platform, how and why it was conceived, how it works and how it can be used to develop quality Smart Solutions.
In particular, two architectures were analyzed where FIWARE is used together with the concept of Digital Twin.

Thanks to my professor Amato Flora and to the MedITech center in Naples
